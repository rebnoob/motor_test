# README.md

Guys to run the code you should run the main.py code under unitree_leg_gui. The code right now is really jank and we need to organize it.

### Notice

support motor: GO-M8010-6 motor、A1 motor、 B1 motor

gcc >= 5.4.0 (for x86 platform)

gcc >= 7.5.0 (for Arm platform) 

run gcc --version  command to check your gcc version

### Build
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run
If the compilation is successful, many C++ example executable files will be generated in the build folder. Then run the examples with 'sudo', for example:
```bash
sudo ./example_a1_motor
```

If you need to run the Python example, please enter the "python" folder. Then run the examples with 'sudo', for example:
```python
sudo python3 example_a1_motor.py
```

### Tip

The code snippet below demonstrates an example of assigning values to the command structure `cmd` in `example_a1_motor.cpp`. It should be noted that the commands are all for the **rotor** side. However, the commands we usually compute are for the **output** side. Therefore, when assigning values, we need to consider the conversion between them.

```c++
cmd.motorType = MotorType::A1;
data.motorType = MotorType::A1;
cmd.mode  = queryMotorMode(MotorType::A1,MotorMode::FOC);
cmd.id    = 0;
cmd.kp    = 0.0;
cmd.kd    = 2;
cmd.q     = 0.0;
cmd.dq    = -6.28*queryGearRatio(MotorType::A1);
cmd.tau   = 0.0;
serial.sendRecv(&cmd,&data);
```
